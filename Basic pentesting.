This file helps you to solve the lab on try hack me called Basic pentesting.
In these set of tasks you'll learn the following:

brute forcing 
hash cracking 
service enumeration
Linux Enumeration
The main goal here is to learn as much as possible. Make sure you are connected to our network using your OpenVPN configuration file.


# Vulnerability Write-up

## Target
- Program: Lab / Practice
- Ip: Labs machine ip

## Summary
Briefly explain what the vulnerability is and what is broken.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. First Deploy machine and connect to network.
2. Find the services using (nmap)
3. Find hidden directory using (dirbuster).
4. Use brute force to find login credentials.(hydra).
5. Service used to access the server.(ssh) login in it and find information as much possible.
6. Find final password and crack it with the help of hash cracker (johnRipper).

## Impact
Attacker first understand the structure of network and thier services running .Then he run directory brute forcing to find hidden files and next he find login credentials , These all steps comes in to reconnassance and 
then he do username enumeration using enum4linux and next he login with ssh and he find private key and bomb he used it to login on another user and find password and done he,s work is finished.
